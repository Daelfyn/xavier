“Get your head around this. Time can beat at different rates, at different points in the universe.”  
Michio Kaku [explains](https://youtube.com/shorts/2dq18cufvcg?si=OAX7sC8DED-gNnpC).

“Do you think time travel will ever be possible?”  
Brian Cox: “Not into the past…” [explains](https://youtube.com/shorts/gsg1KaBxtXI?si=TML65ON815kdSI5P).  
  

Many believe that Xavier has only lived one life and hasn’t died. Any version of MC that he’s met has been through his continuous lifespan. This is because he holds items that have belonged to different versions of MC through time, but this does not imply that every version he had met has been in the same timeline. He has met at least three versions of MC who have no memory of their interactions with him. There is speculation of another possible MC who was “lost with the Aether Core” as [mentioned by Noah](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlu9Ca4L3NMEISX5DpNIzUBjYSQLX0DfyLphuy59AlQ/edit?pli=1#bookmark=kix.pli1f18l6uxs), but no other clues about her are found anywhere else, yet. 

Some speculate that during their space voyage, Xavier found a version of MC and loaded her onto his ship, before facing the problems that had him and the Backtrackers crash on Earth. If there was a version of MC on his spaceship, we don’t know who it was. 

There are debates on whether Xavier is from the future or the past, but some believe neither of these terms applies perfectly given the nature of [spacetime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20spacetime%20is%20a,where%20and%20when%20events%20occur.). If you prefer learning about this in video format, we recommend [this explanation](https://youtu.be/SJhovNXqH6A?si=_KRJm43fAT1KMbyz) by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. As humans, we observe time linearly given our limited perspective. You can read more about time [here](https://www.space.com/29859-the-illusion-of-time.html), particularly the concepts of [space and time](https://physics.bgsu.edu/p433/Spacetime1.html), [time dilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BCkSYQ0NRQ&t=49s), and “[multiverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6OoaNPSZeM).” The game can also use sci-fi elements popular within this genre and explore [hypothetical scenarios](https://www.space.com/where-do-black-holes-lead.html) that are impossible for us currently, such as traveling through a black hole.
